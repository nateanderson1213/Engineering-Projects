# Humidifier Circuit & 3D-Printed Casing

This project was developed as part of an engineering design team, where our team built a working ultrasonic humidifier circuit and custom 3D-printed housing.  

I led the **circuit analysis and schematic design** using a 555 timer, MOSFET driver, and supporting components to drive a piezoelectric transducer. I also worked on creating **3D casing**, including CAD modeling, dimensioned technical drawings, and the final 3D print.

## Features
- 555 timerâ€“based oscillator circuit with duty-cycle tuning
- MOSFET-driven piezoelectric transducer for mist generation
- Custom 3D-printed casing with modular design
- Full technical drawings with manufacturing dimensions

## Skills Highlighted
- Circuit analysis & schematic capture
- Breadboard prototyping & oscilloscope measurement
- CAD modeling & drafting (OnShape)
- 3D printing & enclosure design
