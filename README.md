## Humidifier Circuit & 3D-Printed Casing

This project was developed as part of a larger effort by my pre-professional engineering group to design **low-cost, implementable biomedical devices** for use in developing countries. The humidifier subsystem was created to regulate humidity in a **neonatal incubator**, supporting safe and affordable infant care.

I led the **circuit analysis and schematic design** using a 555 timer, MOSFET driver, and supporting components to drive a piezoelectric transducer. I also designed the **3D-printed casing**, including CAD modeling, dimensioned engineering drawings, and the final manufactured prototype.
